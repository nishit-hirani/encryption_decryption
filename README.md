# encryption_decryption

This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Tkinter for encrypting and decrypting text using a simple password-based encryption scheme. It takes input text, allows encryption with a specific password ("turtle"), and displays the encrypted text using Base64 encoding. Similarly, it decrypts the text if the correct password is provided, displaying the original text. The interface also features buttons for encryption, decryption, and clearing the input fields, enhancing user interaction and ease of use.
